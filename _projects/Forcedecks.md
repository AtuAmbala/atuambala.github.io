This project is a **machine learning application** developed in collaboration with GCU Athletics to analyze force plate data from student-athletes. The goal was to identify correlations between performance in the gym (measured by metrics like jump height and RSI) and performance in the swimming pool. This analysis provides strength coaches with data-driven insights to optimize training programs.

My work on this project involved:

* **Data Preprocessing and Standardization:** I handled raw data, creating unique athlete IDs and standardizing metrics to ensure a clean and consistent dataset for analysis.
* **Machine Learning with K-Means Clustering:** I applied K-Means clustering to segment athletes into groups based on their performance metrics, allowing for targeted analysis of different athletic profiles.
* **Statistical Analysis & Visualization:** Using Python libraries like **NumPy**, **Pandas**, and **Matplotlib**, I performed a detailed statistical analysis and created visualizations to highlight key trends and correlations, such as the direct relationship between jump height and RSI.
* **Scoring Algorithm:** I developed an algorithm to rank the top athletes within each cluster, training group, and swimming stroke, providing coaches with a clear, actionable list of top performers based on the data.
