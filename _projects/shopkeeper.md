## Shopkeeper Project

This is a **Python application** I developed to simulate a shopkeeper's inventory and order management system. The project was built with a strong focus on **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles and the creation of a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**.

The application allows a shopkeeper to:
* Manage inventory by tracking stock levels and prices from a CSV file.
* Process customer orders by item code and quantity.
* Update inventory levels after each sale.
* Generate and display a clean, user-friendly receipt for the customer via a separate GUI window.

The core of the project's functionality is its class structure. Classes like `Stock`, `Inventory`, `Order`, and `Mutiple` are designed to handle the various aspects of a transaction in a modular and organized way. This approach demonstrates how to apply OOP concepts to build a practical, real-world application.

This project highlights my ability to not only apply foundational programming concepts like OOP but also to build interactive applications with user-facing components, showcasing a blend of backend logic and frontend design.
