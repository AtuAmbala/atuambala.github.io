Hi, I’m Atu Ambala — a computer scientist and Graduate Teaching Assistant at Colorado State University, where I’m pursuing advanced research in machine learning and data systems. My academic journey began at Grand Canyon University, where I earned my B.S. in Computer Science, and I am now deepening my expertise in AI, data-driven modeling, and the intersection of computer science and economics.
My research and projects span from traffic and pollution simulations, predictive modeling, and transformer-based text generation, to cross-platform data clean rooms leveraging Snowflake and Azure. I’m particularly passionate about how machine learning can be applied for social good — especially in shaping equitable policies and uplifting low-income regions like my home in Kenya.
Beyond the classroom and lab, I’ve had the privilege of competing at the highest levels of sport as an Olympic and World Championship swimmer, representing Uganda on the international stage. I also swam collegiately as an NCAA Division I athlete, experiences that taught me resilience, focus, and teamwork — qualities I carry into my academic and professional life.
Leadership has also been central to my journey. As SAAC President at GCU and through leading student-athlete workshops, I’ve built skills in mentorship, collaboration, and advocacy, which complement my technical background.
Looking ahead, I’m excited to continue blending research, leadership, and global perspective to drive innovation in computer science and its applications for society.
